#What to Wear
Simple Meteor app that gives fashion suggestions based on the current weather. Originally built before Meteor had
ReactiveVars, so Session variables are used everywhere.

##Installation
A settings.json file must be specified in the project root with an Open Weather Map API key for this to run. The API
documentation is found [here](http://openweathermap.org/api).pi).
