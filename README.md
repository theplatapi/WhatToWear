This is a prototype for an app called What to Wear, which gives a user clothing suggestions based on the weather. All
the drawings are done by me. You can find it live at www.whattowearapp.com.

The wheel at the right is scrollable, and changes the current temperature. It is also touch friendly; try the site on
mobile.

This is a project I started last weekend.
